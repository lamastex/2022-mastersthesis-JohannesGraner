  This test requires that $f$ is twice continuously differentiable.
  For $\x \subseteq \Iint (\X)$, a global (or local) minimum 
  $x \in \x$ must satisfy $\nabla f(x) = 0$.
  This requirement can be exploited by performing 
  one step of the Newton Gauss-Seidel method for finding zeros.
  
  The interval extension of the method is given by computing 
  $\A = \R \cdot \nabla^2 F(\x)$ and $\b = \R \cdot \nabla f(\Imid(\x))$, 
  where $\R \approx (\Imid (\nabla^2 F(\x)))^{-1}$.
  The system $\A (\x - \Imid(\x)) = \b$ is then solved by Gauss-Seidel iteration.
  Let $c = \Imid(\x)$ and $N'_{GS}(\x)$ be as follows.

  \begin{align*}
    \y &= \x \\
    \y_i &= \left( c_i - \A_{ii}^{-1} \left( \b_i + \sum_{j=1,j \neq i}^n \A_{ij} (\y_j - c_j) \right) \right) \cap \y_i,\; i = 1,\dots,n \\
    N'_{GS}(\x) &= \y
  \end{align*}
  The test is then as follows, given $\x \subseteq \Iint(\X)$ and $N'_{GS}(\x)$.

  \begin{itemize}
    \item If $N'_{GS}(\x)$ is empty, then $0 \notin \nabla F(\x)$ and $\x$ is discarded from the search.
    \item If $N'_{GS}(\x) \subseteq \Iint(\x)$, then $\x$ is replaced by the contracted interval \linebreak $N'_{GS}(\x) \cap \x$.
    \item If $0 \in \A_{ii}$, and $\x_i$ is split into a union of two non-empty intervals $\x_i^1$ and $\x_i^2$, then the Gauss-Seidel iteration continues on $\x_i^1$, and $\x_i^2$ is added to the list of intervals to be searched.
  \end{itemize}
  In total, the interval extended Newton Gauss-Seidel method can yield up to $n+1$ new intervals to search.
