  This test requires that $f$ is twice continuously differentiable.
  If $\x$ is contained in the interior of $\X$, 
  then $f$ can only have its global minimum in $\x$ if $f$ is concave over $\x$.
  A necessary condition for concavity is that the 
  Hessian $\nabla^2 f$ is positive semi-definite, 
  which in turn has the necessary condition that 
  all diagonal elements of $\nabla^2 f$ are non-negative.

  The test is as follows, given $\x \subseteq \Iint(\X)$ and 
  the diagonal elements of $\nabla^2 F(\x)$.

  \begin{itemize}
    \item If, for any $i = 1,\dots,n$, $\ul {\nabla^2 F(\x)} < 0$, then remove $\x$ from the search.
  \end{itemize}
