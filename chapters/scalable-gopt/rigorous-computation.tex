  In many scientific domains, measurements are known not only to be inexact, it is also known how inexact they are.
  Such measurement errors accumulate when many measurements are used together in a computation.
  In order to know the error in the final result, a systematic way of accumulating the errors is needed.

  In fact, all floating point operations done on a computer have inherent errors, usually called round-off error.
