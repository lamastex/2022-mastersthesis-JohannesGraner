  The next step from the extremely fine-resolution histogram is to backtrack until
  the number of leaves is small enough to fit into the available memory of a single computer.
  A non-distributed algorithm for this is presented in \cite{scala-density-tree} as Algorithm 3.
  That algorithm takes a (sparse) histogram and a priority function
  $\phi: \text{Count} \times \text{Volume} \to \Rz_{\ge 0}$
  and returns a coarsening sequence of histograms, 
  where each step in the sequence selects the parent node with lowest priority,
  and merges the children of that node.
  The priority function is randomized as ties among several parent nodes
  with the lowest priority are resolved by uniform random sampling.
  Given a limit $\ol \phi$ on the priority function,
  the merging process is stopped when the selected parent node has priority at least $\ol \phi$.
  This ensures that all leaves have priority below $\ol \phi$.

  The distributed version of the algorithm takes advantage of
  the possibility of using sparse histograms by
  partitioning the histogram into subtrees that can be merged separately and then combined.
  This is done iteratively, where each step partitions 
  the histogram into subtrees at a specific depth,
  and that depth decreases until no subtrees have mergeable nodes.
  The distributed algorithm is presented in Algorithm \ref{alg:dist-merge}.

    \caption{distBacktrack$(\phi, \ol \phi, k, s)$}

    \KwIn{
      $\phi: \text{Count} \times \text{Volume} \to \Rz_{\ge 0}$, a priority function,
      
      $\ol \phi$, an upper limit on $\phi$,

      $k$, step size to decrease depth by each iteration,

      $s$, the count-based histogram to be merged.
    }
    \KwOut{
      $s'$, count-based histogram where no more leaves can be merged.
    }

    $s' \gets s$

      }

      $D \gets D - k$
