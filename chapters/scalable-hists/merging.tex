  The algorithms presented in \cite{mrp-raaz-harlow-tucker}, \cite{srp-mde-raaz-teng} and 
  \cite{scala-density-tree} are top-down
  in the sense that they begin with a root box which is 
  recursively split according to a randomized priority function.
  In \cite{scala-density-tree} an algorithm for backtracking by merging leaves
  according to a priority function is presented, but only explored as far as backtracking
  after the splitting algorithm is run.
  Here, an alternative approach is presented,
  which is bottom-up, i.e.~starting from each element in the dataset itself, 
  and more naturally suitable to distributed computing.
