\begin{document}
  Three problems in distributed computing and non-parametric computational statistics are
  explored to develop scalable distributed algorithms.
  The problems are rigorous global optimization, trend detection in time series, and
  non-parametric density estimation with tree-based histograms.
  Scalable algorithms are implemented for each problem using
  the fault-tolerant distributed framework of Apache Spark.
